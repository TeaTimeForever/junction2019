# The issue
Around 20-25 % of young people in Finland will have some kind of mental disorder before they become adults.
Society is struggling with waiting periods for overburdened mental health care support, with people becoming unable to work due to mental issues, and with suicides. Something must change.

# Our mission
Our mission is to encourage and support young people who are between doing well and needing help with training exercises
that will make them mentally more robust to prevent problems in the future.

# The "Upbeat" appliance
So as not to compete with the many distractions of phones or laptops we use the "Upbeat" appliance as the focus for interaction with the user. It contains an e-Ink screen displaying messages in three colours, has a LED-light for a simple signal, and two buttons for interaction. The 3-D printed casing is designed for attachment on walls or doors, where it becomes a non-intrusive part of life.  It can be given to young people by health care officials or teachers, or can be ordered online. 

# Example usage
The demo presents a specific training with exercises where the user is to step outside her or his comfort zone.
Every day a challenge is displayed, which can be accepted or not by pushing one of the buttons. A LED light will turn on
after accepting a challenge to serve as a reminder. It will turn off when the other button is pushed to signal that the challenge has been met. If the other button is pushed, the challenge will be cancelled and the LED light will turn off.

# The "Upbeat" website
Here the user can read background information, select a training based on expected benefits and expectations for exercises,  
and define personal settings for that training.
The selection process can in the future be extended by a Q&A form that will help determining what training is likely beneficial 
 for the specific user. Once a training is selected the user can change its default settings to define the intensity of the training, e.g. let the system provide a deadline and send reminders about this.
                                                                                                                                   
# The role of Mental Health Care Professionals
Health Care professionals develop the trainings by defining the training's goals and the reasons why they expect it will help users.
They collaborate with IT people to realise models of interaction, data structures, and optional settings. Additionally, they are
responsible for the data. In the demo we see the screen where they can add or modify challenges.
Once operational, analytics will show them how many people do the training, how many actually do the exercises, 
whether exercises appeal and work, etc.

# Coaching
In the future the application can be extended to support a program of exercises that a mental health care coach and a client agree on. It then serves to provide input and follow-up for their interactive sessions.
