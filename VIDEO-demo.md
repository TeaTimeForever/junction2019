# Introduction
Around 20-25 % of young people in Finland will have some kind of mental disorder before they become adults. 
The most typical mental disorders are anxiety, depression, eating disorder, and stress. 
Mental Health Care professionals work both to heal people who need help and to prevent others from getting in that position.
More people are seeking help, putting high pressure on health care professionals, while leading to 
long waiting period for those that seek help, and more people become disable to work, whereby they become 
a financial burden to society. Something must change.

# Our mission
Our mission is to improve the situation through improved prevention of mental health issues. 
Our target group are those young people who are between doing well and needing help.
We want to help them to train themselves with exercises to become more mentally robust to prevent problems in the future.

# Holding us back
We want to reach young people and we want to keep their attention and energy for a longer period of time.
For this our approach starts with a little device: a little screen that can be hung on a wall or fridge in 
their home that can get their attention without having to compete with the entertainment offered by their phones
and the work environment on their laptops. We want full attention and no competition with other things in life.

# e-Paper device
The Upbeat device contains an e-paper screen that shows messages in three colours, has two LED-lights for drawing of attention, and two buttons
as sole interaction. The casing is designed for attachment on the wall and was 3-D printed during the hackaton.

The device can be given to young people by health care officials, teachers, or ordered online. By scanning 
a displayed RFID the owner of the device gets and account and access to a website where trainings can be selected
and configured.

The device becomes a visible element of life, without being too obtrusive.

# Using the device
What we see now on the device is one challenge from a training to do something outside of one's comfort zone.
By the current settings a new challenge is displayed every day. By flicking the "accept"
button on the device, the user indicates that he or she accepts the challenge. Currently, when a challenge is
accepted, a green light will indicate this. Then the challenge will remain on the screen until a flick of the
knob will indicate that it has been done, or until it is reset - which comes down to an indication that the 
user has decided not to do it after all or has given up on it.

# Supporting website
Why is our user getting these challenges to stretch her or his comfort zone? 
After initially getting the device, the user has logged in on the associated website. 
First a welcome is shown with a general introduction to the service: what is its goal, what does it offer,
why does it expect this to help *you* become mentally more robust, but also: don't hesitate to seek help if you
think that that is what you need.

# Trainings
After the welcome, the user is invited to have a look at different trainings. This can later be extended by 
asking the user to fill out an interactive form to make an estimation of trainings are expected to be
most suitable and helpful.
The user will see what to expect from the training, what is expected from her or him, and how this training
can be beneficial.
After selecting one training by clicking "start", a form is shown that gives the user to change the 
default settings for the training. These settings give options on the intensity with which the user wants
to do the training, e.g. let the system provide a deadline and send notifications about this, give a choice of a
number of new options.

# Health Care Professionals
There are different roles for Health Care Professionals. In the inception of a new training, 
mental health care professionals define the goal of the training and the reasons why they expect this will 
help people. 
To define the interactions and data structures that form the framework of the training they collaborate with IT people.
Then it is up to them again to enter high quality exercises the make up the training.
In the demo we see where the domain expert can login to add new challenges or modify existing ones.

Once the training is operational, the domain experts keep track of its usage: how many people do the training,
how many seem to actually do the exercises, what exercises seem to work well and what exercises seem not to work well,
etc. On the basis of tracking this, the training can be changed.

# Coaching
As said earlier the user may have obtained the Upbeat device from a health care professional. It can function
as a way to coach people by letting them do exercises under guidance from Upbeat, after which user and coach 
can evaluate together if it worked - or why not - if there was any positive effect from the training, and 
whether this specific training was a good idea. Emphasis here is that the exercises are not a test, but really 
a training to make someone more robust mentally. The user doesn't do things good or less good, but the 
proceedings can serve as input for a coaching conversation on what be good next steps.

# Conclusion
"Upbeat" provides the means for Mental Health Care professionals to reach many more people and encourage and support 
them to do exercises to make their mental health more robust. The demo focuses on the introduction of an
appliance that non-intrusively enters people's lives. From the current demo, multiple promising future extensions 
become imaginable.














# What problem are we trying to solve?




We seek to help people train themselves to become mentally more robust to prevent problems in the future.

#Target group
People who are aware that they are not doing really well while they are not in such a state that they need personal help from health care. Either they should seek for a way to improve their situation “I could try this” or a health care worker decides after contact with them that this might be a good way for them to start strengthening their mental health.

# Contribution from health care workers
Determine if using the application is right for a certain person. If so explain it to them and hand them the Upbeat appliance.
Create the content and interactions for the different trainings in collaboration with IT people

# Variable levels of “pressure”
* Free: suggestions from the app only
* Set your own deadlines
* Set deadlines together with health care workers
* Let health care workers contact you if your results give rise to it, e.g. you are not doing what you set yourself to doing. Can be through chat.
* Can be used in combination with, say, bi-weekly appointment: “How is your self-training working for you?” (data available to both client and health care worker)
Assumptions
* No peer pressure! This is not an application to get into contact with other individuals.
Health care professionals will not intrude without a previous agreement that they may. (Health care professionals will not see results of any person unless there is such an agreement.)

# Upbeat appliance
The appliances serves as a non-intrusive but always available object in people’s lives. It is different from phone as it will not distract with other notifications (“You got mail!”, “Something new on Facebook!”, etc.)
